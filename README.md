### Default description
Zombie Plague is a Counter-Strike server side modification, developed as an AMX Mod X plugin, which completely revamps the gameplay, turning the game into an intense "Humans vs Zombies" survival experience.

### Description
Zombie Plague - This is a special mode in which Zombies fight by Humans. The goal of the game is the victory of your team. You can at any time infect other zombies, so you need to purchase weapons and armor, so, through it, they can not get you. Find an asylum, put Laser Mines and defend yourself until you get help.
